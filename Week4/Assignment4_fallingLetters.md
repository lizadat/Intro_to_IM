# Assignment #4
* The idea was to upload font, to transfer the text to the points, create rectangled there and make them all fall and grow in size and speed if the mouse is pressed.
* I partly used the code we shared in class with Bouncing ellipses.
* I am still in the process of figuring out how to code, have simple mistakes, but I can understand the concepts of what I am doing. 
* Where does the creativity come from? I don't know and sometimes I feel like I need it more.
