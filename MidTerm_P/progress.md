* As of Friday I reached to Part 6 of those videos. I have all 7 types of pieces coming down, they can rotate if Up_arrow is pressed, but for some reason there is an error when I am trying to move them to the left, right or down.
* I have an idea with the image. I want every box of the piece to be filled with a part of the image and than when the piece is placed you can see how much of the image you got. I will think on how to implement that.
* For now I am not sure about the end of the game. Where it will just end when there are no more space for new pieces without losing or winning, or for example if the player managed to see over 60% of the image = he/she will win. I need to think how to implement that as well, but for now I am more concentrated on the game itself.
