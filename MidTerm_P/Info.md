# Midterm Project - Tetris
* For my midterm project for Introduction to Interactive Media class I want to create a tetris game.
* I was inspired by my childhood memories, when I played it on the separate device when there were no phones yet.
* It is a very interesting games which develops your attention skills and motility.
* For shapes: The tetris game is where the 7 different shapes move down, so I will be using the array for creating a shape.

* For image: The idea is to use the pieces of one particular image on the tetris pieces. They will be either filled right when coming down(I do not know how to implement that, because that every tetris piece has to have its specific position) or when they are placed on the bottom.
* For sound: The player will be able to move the tetris pieces with the keyboard and every move will be followed with the specific sound. Also when the piece is plced and the game is over, there will be a notification.
* For on-screen text: In the begining of the game the player will be able to see the message of the game description and will have to press the key for the game to start.
