# Assignment #2 - Illusion

* This is my second work done in p5.js.
* Using the only simple figure - rectangle, I was able to create a hypnosis square. I drew the rectangle, with the center in the center of canva with no fill and stroke weight 10. For the illusion I drew the same king of rectangle, but with +40 in size. 
* To make it moving as an illusion I used the algorithm of adding 1 to a variable and then dividibg it by 2. If 1 is a remainder it is white, else - black. This way it keeps changing beteween 2 colours and creates the illusion of moving.
* I also used the mouseIsPressed feature, so if the mouse is pressed, the colors arerandomly changing.
* The rectangles start from any point, where the mouse is placed.
* 2 difficulties I faced: how to draw those rectangles so each one will be seen (noFill was a solution) and how to keep the colors changing only between white and black (the algorithm of odd and even numbers was used)
