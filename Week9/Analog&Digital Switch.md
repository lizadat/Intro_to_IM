# Analog and Digital Switch
* I created the circuit, with 2 LEDs, one analog and one digital switch.
* Firts of all, I want to say that I am very confused while working with hardware and software. Since it is the first time I use Arduino, I am not acquainted with many things and have mix in my head. However, I feel like the more I work with it the more I explore. 
* Doing this assignment seemed very difficult at first. After the clarification I understood that I need 2 LEDs and they have to be controlled in 2 different ways. So one was a button and another one - the sensor.
* I first tried the tempreture sensor, but the values it was giving were very confusion. Because of the small range (it was like 2 scale factors) was too smal for the LED, so I could not control it's brightness.
* While working in the IM lab I found another sensor - force sensor and connected it to my circuit.
