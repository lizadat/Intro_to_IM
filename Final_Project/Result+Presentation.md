# Final Look
* We finished our project by making a rapping for our car. For that we used a cardboard + paper, printed in red so that our car looked red as in the video game. 
* Here is how it looked liked in the end:

# Presentation in class
* For the presentation in class we had around 7 minutes. We prepared our presentation and also showed how it worked.

* Fortunately, we were able to complete our project before the presentation and nothing went wrong.


# The Presentation Day
* The showcase happened during our class time. It took about 2 mins to set up: turn on the computer, open the code for the game, connect arduino mega to power, which was the powerbank in our case and pair it up with the computer.
* Here is a picture of people, who played our game:

# Feedback and impression of the presentation:
* Everyone really liked our project. The guidelines and the game was very clear, people could figure out how to play. They said that it was very interesting and exciting to play.
* My own impression: people concentrated more on the video game than on the car in reality. The idea was that the person would develop its skills in multitasking when trying to avoid obstacles in the game and in reality. There are 2 things that could be done: we could place some more obstacles in reality, so that the car would actually not be able go everywhere. But it would only be possible if we would have the ultrasonic or distance measure sensor. 

# Nevertheless, I am very satisfied with out project and it all worked out in the way we wanted. While working on it we learned how to use XBee connection, how to solder, fix bugs etc. This class was very cool!
