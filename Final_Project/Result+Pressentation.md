# Final Look
* We finished our project by making a rapping for our car. For that we used a cardboard + paper, printed in red so that our car looked red as in the video game. 
* Here is how it looked liked in the end:

# The Presentation Day
* The showcase happened during our class time. It took about 2 mins to set up: turn on the computer, open the code for the game, connect arduino mega to power, which was the powerbank in our case and pair it up with the computer.
* Here is a picture of people, who played our game:
