# Final Project will be done by Liza and Dilnaz.
# We were planning to make a car using Arduino motors and connect it to p5.js, so it is controlled from the computer.
* Arduino: Arduino circuit will be pretty simple. We will connect 2 motors to 2 wheel which will be on the back of the car and then also one more wheel on the front. Nothing on Arduino will be controlled p5, however, there will be an ultrasound sensor placed at the front of the car, so if it gets close to any object it will stop automatically, which means sending a note to p5 that it cannot move further.
* p5.js : The interface will be a simple drawing of the car. The message like "Press UP arrow to start the car moving" will appear. As soon as the key is pressed the car will move OR if the key was pressed it keeps moving. If the DOWN arrow is pressed - the car moves.
* We might challenge ourselves and try to make the car wireless, which means that Arduino will use Bluetooth or wi-fi in order to "communicate" with p5. 
* Also I would like to make the car be able to turn, also using right and left arrows.
