# First steps on the project:
The project consists of 2 part: Arduino and p5.js. We decided to move together with these 2 parts but by steps. 
* Firstly, we connected motors to Arduino and made sure it worked. However, not everything worked out. The B part of the motor driver did not work. It turned out that the problem was with the brideboard. For some reason ot was not warking, so moving the wires and the motor driver to another part of the board helped.
* Secondly, the main idea of our project is to pass the information from p5.js to Arduino in order to control the car's move. As it will be controlled by the arrows, we decided to use the cases: if up, down, right or left arrow is pressed. If the up_arrow is pressed the car is supposed to move constantly, the down_arrow - reverse, back, the right_arrow - turn right, the left - left. In our plans the the side arrows are pressed only one side of the wheels move abd that is why the car is able to turn. However, it is not for sure yet, we will see how it works when we connect the car completely to Arduino and make aal the wheel move forwards and backwards.
