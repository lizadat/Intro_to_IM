# First steps on the project:
The project consists of 2 part: Arduino and p5.js. We decided to move together with these 2 parts but by steps. 
* Firstly, we connected motors to Arduino and made sure it worked. However, not everything worked out. The B part of the motor driver did not work. It turned out that the problem was with the brideboard. For some reason ot was not warking, so moving the wires and the motor driver to another part of the board helped.
