# The musical Instrument presented by Liza Datsenko & Dilnaz Amantayeva
* We worked together for our assignment to create a musical instrument.
* Progression of our ideas: When we first learned about the assignment, it was really exciting to think of creating a special musical instrument completely out of the analog and digital sensors. At first, when we looked through the arduino musical instrument ideas, we wanted to make something different, using all of our creativity. We were particularly astonished by the idea of using many photoresistors, so that when we move our hand above the resistors, different sounds would come out. However, we thought that it would be too easy and too used up as a musical instrument, so we continued brainstorming other ideas. Liza suggested to use force sensors and create something similar to a game “dance board” by placing those force sensors on the floor. However, to do that we would need really long wires, so moved the idea to tapping the force sensors with fingers. For Dilnaz, it was very interesting to work with the servo motor, and we saw a potential of making something similar to maracas. The idea was to use Kinder Joy, put grains into the eggs and somehow stick them to the motor. Thus, when the motor would move, the eggs would also move and create an interesting sound. We gathered all the necessary materials and decided to stick to that idea of including both creative maracas and tappable force sensors (call it drums or piano).
* Process: 1). We met for the first time and did some research, looking for ideas of what to make. We watched over a dozen videos of previous projects and as a result came up with the idea of what to do. 2). When meeting the second time we tried doing some hardware. As the initial idea was to make a servo motor work when the force sensor is touched we tried doing that.

* Also, we wanted to control the volume with the potentiometer.

* Issues we had: Motor servo was not working in the if statement. The sound was still playing when the force sensor was off (we believe that the problem was a potentiometer). The potentiometer was not working together with the force sensor (we were trying to control the sound with the potentiometer). 3). The third time we met in the IM lab in order to start actually making the instrument. We cut the cardboard and placed 5 force sensors on it. This is how it looked:

Decided to not use the potentiometer. For some reason, the speaker was playing by itself different sounds, when the sensors were not touched. At some point the code was not working on any of our laptops, so we had to rewrite it. The servo motor was not working together with the if statement (most probably because of the delay it had). We tried using the millis function, but did not succeed. We haven’t started with maracas because the motor was not working. On that day we finished with this:

As a consequence of our previous meeting, we decided to use a switch: when it is on: the servo motor is working; off - the force sensors. In this way we did not have to deal with the delay or anything like that. Creating the for loop we made the motor turn 50 degrees every second, so we were able to start on making maracas. Using the 2 packs from Kinder, putting some seeds inside and gluing two parts of the pack together (normal glue did not work, so we used the hot glue), we created sound-making pieces. Result:

To place it on the servo motor we glued these parts to a wooden stick and then to one of the parts that connects to the motor itself. All worked perfectly except our last force sensor. It worked, but made the note sound terrible. We were not able to find out why (maybe because it was too much for Arduino). From time to time our speaker was also making weird noises, regardless of force sensors being touched. This is how our musical instrument looked like:

* For the sake of creativity and good looking we printed the notes and glued it on the cardboard. For better understanding where to touch and play the instrument - we used the rose highlighter to mark the specific places. This is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRXq5PN1AzQ) of our final work.
* We presented our musical instruments in class. It seems that the force sensor part was not that unexpected, which we cannot say about maracas. When the switch was on and it started working there was WOW-effect. Looks like the students like it. Presentation:

* Result: We ended up making a board with 5 force sensors placed on it. We connected the force sensors to the breadboard by using little clips. We coded different notes to each sensor using a pitches.h library, so that when each force sensor is tapped, different sounds come out. The sensors are 3*3 cm and placed along the cardboard 1.5 cm apart from each other, so it is convenient to play with your fingers. To keep it creative, we stuck a picture of musical notes on the board, to cover the wires and force sensor. Also, we created maracas. Using the pack from Kinder, we filled them with very small grains. We actively used different materials from the IM lab: we stuck the Kinder eggs to a thin wooden board on different ends of it using hot glue. Then, we stuck the board to the servo motor, so that when the motor moves, the wooden board moves as well.
