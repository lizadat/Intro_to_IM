# My creative switch
* In class we talked about different conductors and on of those mentioned was water. I thought it would be idea to work with it.
* I talked to my dad who is electrician and he suggested to make a salt solution for the water to be a better conductor. So in 300 ml of water I added 3 tea spoons of salt. It became very salty, I even tried (better not).
* The idea of my switch is: when water is poured - the switch is on. Which means that the procces is going on and when stops - the LED light which I used in my circuit is off. 
* To make it I used the water bottle. I cut the top part of it to be my smaller tank where I pour the water in and the bottom of the bottle became by bottom for my small tank. In order for the switch to "run" I made a small hall on the bottom my small tank, so the water runs out to the bottom.
