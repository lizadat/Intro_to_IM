# My creative switch
* In class we talked about different conductors and on of those mentioned was water. I thought it would be idea to work with it.
* I talked to my dad who is electrician and he suggested to make a salt solution for the water to be a better conductor. So in 300 ml of water I added 3 tea spoons of salt. It became very salty, I even tried (better not).
* The idea of my switch is: when water is poured - the switch is on. Which means that the procces is going on and when stops - the LED light which I used in my circuit is off. 
* To make it I used the water bottle. I cut the top part of it to be my smaller tank where I pour the water in and the bottom of the bottle became by bottom for my small tank. In order for the switch to "run" I made a small hall on the bottom my small tank, so the water runs out to the bottom.
* For this to work I placed two wires in my small tank and places them using tape. As soon as there is water between them - there is another conduction (water) which closes my circiut.

* This is the image of "starting point", where the switch is off, the light is off, there is no water poured.

* As soon as I start pouring water in my tank - the "switch" is on (my two wires are connected with another conductor - salty water) and the light starts shining. If I stop pouring the water - the water in the small tank runs down to the bottom tank and the light stops shining. It might take a few second though.

* To my mind, it was no hard to do, but seems to be creative as it doesn't involve any pressing or "connecting". Even though my hands are involved, it is just for the sake of anything working, we do things with our hands.
* While working on my assignment I did not find it hard to figure out how the circuit works and come up with the idea. However, while working with the water and electricity I had to be super carefull. A few times I spilled the water on my breadboard, which made me very scared. Hopefully, I checked again and everything worked. 
* I really like this assignment, cause I could come up with a different "creativity" than before.
