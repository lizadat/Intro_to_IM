# Exercises
* Exercise a: make the ellipse move horisontally, which is controlled by one sensor. I chose it to be ultrasound sensor. It measures the distance and maps into the values of the width of my canva and then draws a new ellipse on the mapped x position. I made the ellipses be drawn every time on a new background with transparency, which allows to see the previous ellipses. My range is 20 cm for the sensor, so if my hand is in its furthest - the ellipse is drawn on the right edge; in the closest - the left edge. I did not have problems with doing this exercises, however the ultrasound sensor sometimes is not precise enough, it can give very different values when the object is in front of it and not moving.
* Exercise b: I had to make something on p5.js that controls the LED brightness. First, I tried using mouseX, but it did not work out. I thought that the problem was that I move fast or something, but even when I started using the square that moves up and down changing y value, which I mapped for LED range, it still did not work out. After meeting with professor, we figured out that the problem was in analogWrite, but I am still not sure exactly what the problem was.
