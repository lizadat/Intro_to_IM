#Assignment3 - Rotational Star
* I drow the star which is rotating.
* You can add more stars by mousePressed function.
* The star have random colors.
* All of them are rotating.
* What's weird is that thy rotate with bigger speed if more stars are drown. I don't know how it happens.
* I wanted to work a little bit with translation and rotation, so putting that in the class was a little bit challenging, but as a result it worked out.
