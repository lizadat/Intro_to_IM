# Assignment #3 - ArtWork with OOP

* This is my third work done in p5.js.
* I created an artwork using the OOP
* The class Wave was created (originally I wanted the artwork to look as the waves). Using the simple figure ellipse and class I could easily draw 200 ellipses which have random size and color. They are also moving by x-axes and return to the 0. 
* I was a little bit confused with the syntaxes of the classes and the variables such as this.something, but after completing the work I feel much more confident.
